# r-projects
This is a repository of my R projects

1) Accept/reject sampling - This is a simple implementation to understand Shiny R implementation. Generated standard normal variate using Accept Reject technique. Accept reject is a fast sampling technique that can be used to generate random variate. Shiny implementaion is at https://datawindow.shinyapps.io/shiny/

2) Survey of algorithms - Implemented various machine learning algorithms using R
